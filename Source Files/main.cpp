		or else memory overflow

			3.Job Title
			4.Country
		Programme will display all records (if any) in a sorted
		fashion(ascending or descending, any is fine)
		according to Country
		-Programme should provide search function by AT MOST TWO
		attributes. For instance, Skills x Job Title or
		Skills x Country, etc. Attributes mentioned in the
		previous point are recommended
		This function can be done either at a single step, keying in
		two values of attribute at the same time. Or an extension
		function of the SINGLE attribute search. Users can be prompted
		to see whether he/she wishes to do deeper search after single
		attribute search is done.
	5. Task 2-4 must have a timer that times the operation(s) and
		displays the time elapsed after operation(s). Sub-function
		timing is not required.
		-For task 2, only the total time for inserting
		single batch of data should be displayed.
		-For task 3, only the total time taken for deletion of a
		single record should be displayed (maybe also single batch)
		-For task 4, only the total time taken for searching for a
